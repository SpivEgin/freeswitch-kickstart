# Overview
Vagrant/Salt configuration for automatically deploying a [FreeSWITCH](https://freeswitch.org) server.

The project strives to provide these three things:

 1. An easy way to get up and running with a local FreeSWITCH development environment
 2. A sane/convenient starting point for rolling a production server.
 3. A nice starter template for admins who want their FreeSWITCH server under Salt server configuration management.

A **ton** of stuff is done automagically for you -- even if you don't like/need it all, it's still an awesome way to get going!

See [FEATURES](FEATURES.md) for a fairly comprehensive list.

## Installation

See [INSTALL](INSTALL.md).
